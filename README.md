# internal-demos  

Repo for on-premises and private demos.  

Experimental traveling salesman problem solver on a road network (from your pals at [Arogi](http://arogi.com)).
  
Status: Files in the /tests directory tend to be the "canary" releases. If you are looking for an interactive demo of a TSP on a road network, as of 11 October 2016, try /tests/matrixdecode.html  
  
Note to Contributors:  
Older versions of build.sh would create a redundant network-tsp directory in your local repo. If you notice such a redundant directory, make sure you have the latest iterations of the code -- and, of course, do not push the redundant directory up to GitHub.

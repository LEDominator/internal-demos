# internal-demos  

Repo for internal demos: mclp, p-median, & vrp. Although everything in this repo is public, the code contains hooks to APIs that only work on Arogi servers.  

Note to Contributors:  
Older versions of build.sh would create a redundant network-tsp directory in your local repo. If you notice such a redundant directory, make sure you have the latest iterations of the code -- and, of course, do not push the redundant directory up to GitHub.  

License:  
This repo's Arogi Circuit Web demos are free & open source under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE.md). The repo uses a smattering of other open source libraries too, and you will find credits to them in the code-- particular thanks to Google, Mapzen, and Leaflet.
